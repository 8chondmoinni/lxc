## What is Skylife Sample Robot 2.25?
 
Skylife Sample Robot 2.25 is a Windows-based application that can sample and record from any audio/midi device[^1^]. It can also import single sound libraries from audio-format sample CDs and separate out each sample and map them to a range of MIDI keys[^2^]. The software allows you to specify the range and spacing of MIDI notes to be sampled, the number and settings of velocity layers, the note and release lengths, and the loop points. You can also adjust the pitch, volume, filter, and envelope of each sample after recording. Once you have captured your samples, you can export them in raw WAV, Halion, or Soundfont 2 formats[^1^]. You can then load them into your software sampler of choice and enjoy your custom sound library.
 
## Why use Skylife Sample Robot 2.25?
 
Skylife Sample Robot 2.25 has many advantages over manual sampling methods. Here are some of them:
 
- It saves you time and hassle. You don't have to record each note and layer separately, edit and trim each sample, create loop points, map the samples to MIDI keys, and save them in different formats. Sample Robot does all that for you automatically.
- It ensures consistent quality and accuracy. You don't have to worry about variations in pitch, volume, timing, or noise when sampling different notes or layers. Sample Robot maintains a constant level and syncs the samples to a reference tone.
- It preserves the original character and expression of your sound source. You don't have to compromise on the dynamics, articulation, or modulation of your instrument when sampling it. Sample Robot captures every nuance and detail of your sound with high fidelity.
- It expands your sonic possibilities. You don't have to limit yourself to the sounds available in commercial sample libraries or on your current hardware/software setup. Sample Robot lets you create your own unique sounds from any source you can imagine.
